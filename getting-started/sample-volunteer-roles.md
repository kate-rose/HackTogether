# Sample Volunteer Roles

All the organizers need to be hands on to get people to this event and keep them motivated to cross the finish line on Sunday. Reiterate to your volunteers that there is always something to do during down time, whether it's tidying up, checking in with groups and ensuring everyone has all the resources and supplies they need, or preparing for the next event on the schedule.
