# Sample Volunteer Roles

All the organizers need to be hands on to get people to this event and keep them motivated to cross the finish line on Sunday. Reiterate to your volunteers that there is always something to do during down time, whether it's tidying up, checking in with groups and ensuring everyone has all the resources and supplies they need, or preparing for the next event on the schedule.

Other roles, like Social Media Manager, can be necessary to the success of an event. We encourage you to add volunteer roles that suit your audience and process. You may have more complex logistical needs, help on hand for sourcing hardware supplies, or mediators to help your attendees work through difficult conversations. 

Bring your entire organizer team together to define these roles, as ideas about where help is needed are best assessed from multiple points of view, and in response to all the kinds of work already being done to prepare.
