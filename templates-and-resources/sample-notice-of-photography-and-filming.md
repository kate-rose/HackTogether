# Sample Notice of Photography & Filming

The following template was used at several events and may not fit your event's photography and filming needs. We recommend having this reviewed by someone with expertise in the filming needs and legal constraints of any facility you'll be holding your hackathon in. 

This notice of filming and photography should allow attendees to opt out using a visual identifier that has been designated at your event, like a bright sticker on a name badge or different color lanyard to indicate that they do not wish to be recorded.

Please note at the end of this agreement we chose to give our attendees the right to request removal of posted materials, as this can help groups working on especially safety-sensitive issues to reassess their needs at a later date.
