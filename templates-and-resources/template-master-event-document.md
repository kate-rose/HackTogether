# Template Master Event Document

The template Google Doc linked below has been used for several different social good hackathons, and is broken in to several components:

1. Volunteer role signup tab
2. Volunteer contact info tab
3. Public schedule draft \(this will be written up on a whiteboard at the event\)
4. Tabs for each of the day's detailed schedules \(this one presumes a standard Friday thru Sunday weekend hackathon\)
5. A tab with a list of all social media and other online accounts for the hackathon, and who is responsible for maintaining them
6. Supplies and equipment checklist tab
7. Organizer areas of responsibility and check-ins tab

This document is intended to be transparent and shared with volunteers, but not all hackathon attendees unless your group finds it helpful. Make a copy of this document and change it to suit your event's needs:
